### Description
This dataset contains simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals recorded from 12 participants while performing a silent naming task and three sensory-based imagery tasks using visual, auditory, and tactile perception.
Participants were asked to visualize an object in their minds, imagine the sounds made by the object, and imagine the feeling of touching the object.


### EEG
EEG data were acquired with a BioSemi ActiveTwo system with 64 electrodes positioned according to the international 10-20 system, plus one electrode on each earlobe as references ('EXG1' channel is the left ear electrode and 'EXG2' channel is the right ear electrode).
Additionally, 2 electrodes placed on the left hand measured galvanic skin response ('GSR1' channel) and a respiration belt around the waist measured respiration ('Resp' channel).
The sampling rate was 2048 Hz.

The electrode names were saved in a default BioSemi labeling scheme (A1-A32, B1-B32). See the Biosemi documentation for the corresponding international 10-20 naming scheme (https://www.biosemi.com/pics/cap_64_layout_medium.jpg, https://www.biosemi.com/headcap.htm).

For convenience, the following ordered channels
```
['A1', 'A2', 'A3', 'A4', 'A5', 'A6', 'A7', 'A8', 'A9', 'A10', 'A11', 'A12', 'A13', 'A14', 'A15', 'A16', 'A17', 'A18', 'A19', 'A20', 'A21', 'A22', 'A23', 'A24', 'A25', 'A26', 'A27', 'A28', 'A29', 'A30', 'A31', 'A32', 'B1', 'B2', 'B3', 'B4', 'B5', 'B6', 'B7', 'B8', 'B9', 'B10', 'B11', 'B12', 'B13', 'B14', 'B15', 'B16', 'B17', 'B18', 'B19', 'B20', 'B21', 'B22', 'B23', 'B24', 'B25', 'B26', 'B27', 'B28', 'B29', 'B30', 'B31', 'B32']
```
can thus be renamed to
```
['Fp1', 'AF7', 'AF3', 'F1', 'F3', 'F5', 'F7', 'FT7', 'FC5', 'FC3', 'FC1', 'C1', 'C3', 'C5', 'T7', 'TP7', 'CP5', 'CP3', 'CP1', 'P1', 'P3', 'P5', 'P7', 'P9', 'PO7', 'PO3', 'O1', 'Iz', 'Oz', 'POz', 'Pz', 'CPz', 'Fpz', 'Fp2', 'AF8', 'AF4', 'AFz', 'Fz', 'F2', 'F4', 'F6', 'F8', 'FT8', 'FC6', 'FC4', 'FC2', 'FCz', 'Cz', 'C2', 'C4', 'C6', 'T8', 'TP8', 'CP6', 'CP4', 'CP2', 'P2', 'P4', 'P6', 'P8', 'P10', 'PO8', 'PO4', 'O2']
```


### fNIRS
fNIRS data were acquired with a NIRx NIRScoutXP continuous wave imaging system equipped with 4 light detectors, 8 light emitters (sources), and low-profile fNIRS optodes.
Both electrodes and optodes were placed in a NIRx NIRScap for integrated fNIRS-EEG layouts.
Two different montages were used: frontal and temporal, see references for more information.


### Stimulus
Folder 'stimuli' contains all images of the semantic categories of animals and tools presented to participants.


### Example code
We have prepared example scripts to demonstrate how to load the EEG and fNIRS data into Python using MNE and MNE-BIDS packages. These scripts are located in the 'code' directory.
